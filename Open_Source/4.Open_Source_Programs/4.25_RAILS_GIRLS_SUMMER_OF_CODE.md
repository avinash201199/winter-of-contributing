Rails Girls Summer of Code is an award-winning global fellowship program aimed at bringing more diversity into Open Source. It welcomes all women and non-binary applicants who want to gain a footing in the world of coding and further expand their knowledge and skills. The focus is on advanced-beginners who want to enter programming full-time.<br>

As a fellowship program, successful applicants are paid a monthly stipend, from July to September. This breaks down all-too-common financial barriers, allowing students to work on a worthwhile Open Source project.<br>

Working in two-person teams, students are supported by a mentor directly involved with the Open Source project, and independent coaches with extensive developer experience.<br>

## Organiser of Rails Girls Summer of Code

RGSoC is a project run by not-for-profit organization Travis Foundation. It operates solely on the generous donations of sponsors and individuals from the community.<br>

The scholarship program started in 2013. Since then, RGSoC has supported 205 students working in 81 sponsored teams and 28 volunteering teams. In 2018 we welcomed our first part-time teams.

## When does RGSoC take place?

A RGSoC season runs for a full three months, between the first working weekday in July and the last one in September. 

## Who is eligible to participate?

All people with non-binary gender identities or who identify as female (transgender or cisgender) are welcome to apply.

Further to this, they look for applicants:

* who are involved with, or have attended one or more workshops organized by communities like Rails Girls, Railsbridge, Black Girls Code, PyLadies, or similar initiatives
with at least a yearâ€™s experience of continuous learning, i.e. people who have significantly expanded their programming skills in a study group, or independently, by working on a suitable project.They will ask for coding examples
* who can spend 3 months (July, August and September) working full- or part-time on their Open Source project of choice
* who are proficient (spoken and written) in English. You will be communicating with several people from different countries, writing daily logs and blog posts, and English is our common language of communication
* who have never participated in our program as a sponsored team before


You do not have to be a University student or graduate to apply. They expect most applicants will be aged 18 or over but there is no upper age limit.

## How much is the scholarship?

The scholarship will be based on where you live, your set expenses, and any special circumstances you wish to share with us for consideration when you submit your application
